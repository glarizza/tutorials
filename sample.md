# This is a sample tutorial

This tutorial exists to demonstrate what can be done and to test out the
functionality of Google Cloud Shell.

## Getting started

Let's get started by creating a new Cloud SDK configuration with the following
command:

```bash
gcloud config configurations create getting-started
```
**Tip: Click the copy button on the right side of the code box to paste the
command directly into the Cloud Shell terminal; then run it.**

Next let's work with the Cloud Editor. First create a file to edit:

```bash
touch ~/myfile.txt
```

<walkthrough-editor-open-file
filePath="myfile.txt"> Now click this link to open the file
with the Cloud Editor so you can edit it directly.
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>

Continue on to the next section to complete the tutorial

## Conclusion

Great, you're done!
